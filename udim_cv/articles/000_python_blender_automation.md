  "technical_details": "The system is built primarily in Python, using the Blender Python API for deep integration with Blender's functionality. It implements custom Blender operators and panels for user interaction, while maintaining a separate Python backend for heavy processing tasks. Computer vision algorithms analyze textures and geometry for optimization opportunities, while a machine learning model trained on historical render data suggests optimal render settings. The distributed rendering system uses a master-worker architecture with load balancing and fault tolerance. Asset processing includes automatic UV unwrapping, texture optimization, and LOD generation. The system can process thousands of assets per day with minimal human intervention, maintaining consistent quality through automated validation checks.",
