  "technical_details": "Character rigging utilizes Blender's Rigify addon combined with custom bone systems for advanced deformation and control. The facial rig includes detailed muscle simulation and corrective shape keys for realistic expressions and dialogue. Motion capture integration is achieved through custom Python scripts that process mocap data and apply it to the character rig with automatic cleanup and refinement. Animation follows traditional principles with careful attention to timing, spacing, and secondary motion. The lip sync system uses phoneme-based shape keys with automatic timing adjustment based on audio analysis. Crowd animation utilizes particle systems and geometry nodes for efficient background character animation. Camera work employs cinematic techniques including dynamic camera moves, depth of field effects, and composition rules. The rendering pipeline is optimized for animation with motion blur, consistent lighting, and efficient memory usage. Post-production includes color grading, visual effects, and sound design using Blender's integrated tools. The project demonstrates advanced storytelling techniques through character performance, environmental storytelling, and visual narrative structure.",
