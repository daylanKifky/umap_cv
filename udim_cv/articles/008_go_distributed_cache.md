  "technical_details": "The distributed cache is implemented in Go, leveraging goroutines and channels for concurrent processing and efficient resource utilization. The sharding algorithm uses consistent hashing with virtual nodes to ensure balanced data distribution and minimize data movement during cluster changes. Leader election is implemented using the Raft consensus algorithm through etcd integration, ensuring strong consistency for cluster metadata. The cache supports multiple eviction policies including LRU, LFU, and TTL-based expiration with background cleanup processes. Data replication is configurable with support for synchronous and asynchronous replication modes to balance consistency and performance requirements. The networking layer uses gRPC for efficient binary communication between nodes with support for streaming and multiplexing. Memory management is optimized with object pooling and careful garbage collection tuning to minimize latency spikes. Hot-spot detection algorithms monitor access patterns and automatically redistribute frequently accessed data across multiple nodes. The system includes comprehensive monitoring with Prometheus metrics and supports distributed tracing for performance analysis. Deployment is facilitated through Docker containers and Kubernetes operators for automated scaling and management. Performance benchmarks show sub-millisecond latency for cache hits and linear scalability up to 100+ nodes.",
