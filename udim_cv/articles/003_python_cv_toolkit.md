  "technical_details": "The toolkit combines traditional computer vision techniques with state-of-the-art deep learning models for medical image analysis. Tumor detection is implemented using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on large datasets of annotated medical images, achieving 94% accuracy in preliminary studies. The 3D reconstruction module uses advanced algorithms including marching cubes and surface reconstruction techniques to generate detailed 3D models from CT and MRI scans. Image preprocessing includes sophisticated noise reduction algorithms, contrast enhancement, and standardization techniques to improve analysis accuracy. The system supports various medical imaging formats including DICOM, NIfTI, and standard image formats. Integration with ITK (Insight Toolkit) and VTK (Visualization Toolkit) provides robust image processing and visualization capabilities. The toolkit has been validated in 5 research institutions and is currently being used in clinical studies for early cancer detection. Performance optimization includes GPU acceleration for deep learning inference and parallel processing for batch analysis of large image datasets.",
