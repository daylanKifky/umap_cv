  "technical_details": "The simulation engine is built in C++ with extensive use of modern C++17 features for performance and maintainability. CUDA kernels handle parallel computation of particle interactions, collision detection, and physics updates, achieving significant speedup over CPU-only implementations. The rendering pipeline uses OpenGL 4.5 with compute shaders for additional GPU-based processing. Spatial partitioning algorithms like octrees and spatial hashing optimize collision detection for large particle counts. The physics simulation implements Verlet integration for stability and supports various force models including gravitational, electromagnetic, and spring forces. Memory management is optimized for GPU usage with careful consideration of memory coalescing and bandwidth utilization. The system supports both rigid body and soft body physics, with deformable objects using mass-spring models. Real-time performance is maintained through level-of-detail techniques and adaptive time stepping. The user interface is built with Qt, providing intuitive controls for simulation parameters and real-time visualization options. Cross-platform compatibility is ensured through CMake build system and careful platform abstraction. The engine has been used in several research publications and educational institutions for physics simulation studies.",
