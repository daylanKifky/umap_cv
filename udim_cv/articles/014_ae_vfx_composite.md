  "technical_details": "The compositing workflow utilizes After Effects' advanced keying tools including Keylight and custom matte extraction techniques for clean green screen removal. Motion tracking is performed using Mocha Pro for planar tracking and After Effects' built-in tracker for point tracking, enabling seamless integration of CG elements. Particle systems created with Trapcode Particular simulate environmental effects including fire, smoke, rain, and atmospheric particles with realistic physics and lighting interaction. 3D integration uses Element 3D and Cinema 4D integration for dimensional elements and environments. Color grading employs a cinematic workflow with primary and secondary corrections, color matching, and look development using Color Finesse and built-in tools. Atmospheric effects include volumetric lighting, fog, and haze created through particle systems and adjustment layers. Rotoscoping and paint work utilize advanced brush tools and temporal interpolation for efficient cleanup of unwanted elements. The project maintains proper color management throughout the pipeline with Rec. 709 monitoring and delivery specifications. Rendering optimization includes multi-machine rendering and efficient caching strategies for complex compositions. Final delivery includes multiple formats for festival submission and broadcast distribution.",
