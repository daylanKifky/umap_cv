  "technical_details": "The animation process begins with traditional watercolor painting on paper, with each frame hand-painted to capture the organic flow and transparency characteristics of the medium. The painting technique emphasizes wet-on-wet and wet-on-dry methods to achieve various textural effects and color bleeding patterns. Digital capture is performed using high-resolution scanning with color calibration to preserve the subtle color variations and paper texture. Frame-by-frame animation follows traditional principles with careful attention to timing and spacing, utilizing the natural irregularities of hand-painted frames to enhance the organic feel. Digital compositing in After Effects and TVPaint adds subtle enhancements while preserving the handmade quality, including dust and texture overlays, color correction, and atmospheric effects. The narrative structure employs abstract storytelling techniques, using color, movement, and form to convey emotional themes rather than literal representation. Sound design complements the visual rhythm with ambient textures and musical elements that enhance the meditative quality. The final piece demonstrates advanced understanding of both traditional animation principles and contemporary digital workflow integration.",
