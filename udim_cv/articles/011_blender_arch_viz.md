  "technical_details": "The architectural model is created using precise measurements and CAD integration with FreeCAD for technical accuracy. Material systems are developed using Substance Painter for texture creation and Blender's node editor for complex material behaviors including weathering, aging, and environmental interaction. Lighting is achieved through a combination of HDRI environments and artificial light sources with accurate IES profiles for realistic illumination. The rendering pipeline utilizes Cycles with GPU acceleration and advanced sampling techniques to achieve photorealistic quality. Dynamic lighting systems allow for time-of-day variations and seasonal changes through automated sun positioning and sky simulation. The virtual tour functionality is implemented using Unreal Engine integration, enabling real-time exploration with high-quality graphics. Landscape design includes procedural terrain generation, vegetation placement, and water simulation systems. Post-processing workflows include color grading, atmospheric effects, and compositing for final presentation quality. The project includes technical documentation capabilities for generating construction drawings and material specifications directly from the 3D model.",
