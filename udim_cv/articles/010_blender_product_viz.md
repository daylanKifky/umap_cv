  "technical_details": "The visualization pipeline is built using Blender's Python API for automation and batch processing capabilities. The system analyzes product geometry to automatically determine optimal camera angles and lighting positions using computer vision algorithms. Material assignment is handled through an intelligent system that recognizes surface properties and applies appropriate physically-based materials from a comprehensive library. The lighting rig uses a three-point lighting setup with additional fill lights that adapt based on product characteristics and desired mood. Rendering optimization includes adaptive sampling, motion blur, and depth of field calculations to create professional-quality images. The compositor automatically handles background removal, color correction, and output formatting for various platforms. Quality control is implemented through automated checks for proper exposure, focus, and composition. The system integrates with popular e-commerce platforms through REST APIs, enabling direct upload and metadata management. Performance optimization allows for rendering of complex products within 2-3 minutes per image while maintaining broadcast-quality standards.",
