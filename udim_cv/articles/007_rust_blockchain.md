  "technical_details": "The blockchain implementation leverages Rust's memory safety and performance characteristics for building a secure and efficient distributed system. The consensus mechanism uses a proof-of-stake algorithm with validator selection based on stake weight and randomness, ensuring energy efficiency and security. Smart contracts are executed in a WebAssembly (WASM) runtime, providing language-agnostic contract development while maintaining security through sandboxing. The transaction processing pipeline implements parallel execution with conflict detection and resolution, achieving over 1000 transactions per second. Sharding is implemented to distribute transaction processing across multiple chains while maintaining cross-shard communication. The networking layer uses libp2p for peer-to-peer communication with support for various transport protocols and NAT traversal. Cryptographic operations use industry-standard libraries with support for digital signatures, merkle trees, and zero-knowledge proofs. State management is handled by RocksDB for efficient key-value storage with support for atomic transactions and snapshots. The system includes comprehensive testing with property-based testing and formal verification for critical components. Governance mechanisms allow stakeholders to vote on protocol upgrades and parameter changes through on-chain governance contracts.",
