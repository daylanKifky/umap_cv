  "technical_details": "The dashboard architecture leverages React with TypeScript for type-safe component development and Redux for centralized state management. Real-time functionality is implemented using Socket.IO, enabling bi-directional communication between clients and servers with automatic fallback to long-polling for older browsers. The widget system is built on a plugin architecture allowing developers to create custom visualizations using a standardized API. Data visualization is powered by D3.js with custom React wrappers, supporting interactive charts, graphs, and complex data representations. The theming system uses CSS-in-JS with Material-UI as the base design system, enabling dynamic theme switching and brand customization. Performance optimization includes virtual scrolling for large datasets, lazy loading of widgets, and intelligent caching strategies. The backend API is built with Node.js and Express, connecting to MongoDB for data persistence and Redis for session management. The system handles high concurrency with connection pooling and implements rate limiting to ensure stable performance under load. Security features include JWT authentication, CSRF protection, and input validation to prevent common web vulnerabilities.",
