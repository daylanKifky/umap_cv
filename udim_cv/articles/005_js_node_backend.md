  "technical_details": "The microservices architecture is implemented using Node.js with Express.js framework, following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles for service boundaries. Each service is containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Kubernetes for automated scaling and deployment. The API gateway implements rate limiting, authentication, and request routing using Kong or AWS API Gateway. Data persistence is handled by MongoDB with replica sets for high availability and Redis for caching and session storage. The system uses GraphQL for efficient data fetching, reducing over-fetching and enabling flexible client queries. Inter-service communication is implemented using message queues (RabbitMQ) for asynchronous processing and HTTP/gRPC for synchronous calls. Monitoring is implemented using Prometheus for metrics collection, Grafana for visualization, and ELK stack for centralized logging. The circuit breaker pattern is implemented using libraries like Hystrix to prevent cascade failures. Performance optimization includes connection pooling, query optimization, and intelligent caching strategies. The system is deployed on AWS using services like ECS, RDS, and ElastiCache, with multi-region deployment for disaster recovery.",
