  "technical_details": "The infographics system utilizes After Effects' expression language extensively for data-driven animations and dynamic content generation. Data import is handled through custom JavaScript scripts that parse CSV files and JSON data sources, automatically generating keyframes and animation parameters. Chart animations use mathematical expressions to create smooth transitions and reveal effects for bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and complex data visualizations. The template system includes master controllers that allow for easy customization of colors, timing, and data sources without requiring After Effects expertise. Accessibility features include high contrast modes, scalable text, and audio description tracks for visually impaired users. The modular approach enables rapid production of new content by simply updating data sources and customizing visual elements. Real-time data connections are achieved through web APIs and automated refresh systems for live dashboard applications. Animation principles focus on clarity and engagement, using appropriate timing and visual hierarchy to guide viewer attention. Quality assurance includes automated testing of data accuracy and visual consistency across different datasets. Delivery formats include web-optimized videos, interactive HTML5 exports, and high-resolution versions for presentation use.",
