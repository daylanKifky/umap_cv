  "technical_details": "The system architecture follows a microservices pattern with separate components for crawling, processing, and storage. The crawler service uses Scrapy framework with custom middleware for handling complex scenarios like CAPTCHA solving and session management. Redis serves as both a message queue for distributing crawling tasks and a cache for storing temporary data. The data processing pipeline includes natural language processing for text extraction, image recognition for product categorization, and machine learning models for data quality assessment. The entire system is containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Kubernetes for automatic scaling based on workload. Monitoring is implemented using Prometheus and Grafana, providing real-time insights into scraping performance, success rates, and system health. The system processes over 1 million pages daily with 99.9% uptime and includes comprehensive error handling for network failures, rate limiting, and content changes.",
